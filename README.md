# Weather-App

<p>So I thought of building little blocks and solidifying my knowledge of Javascript</p>

Virtually <em>everyone</em> builds a weather app this days, I choose to follow suit and in 
the process learn to become aa better Engineer with real and awesome projects in my repo

This app uses the <b>location</b> and <b>local time</b> of your computer in rendering some of its features

It also uses the open Skycons weather glyphs designed by <a href ="https://darkskyapp.github.io/skycons/"> Dark Sky Company</a>

<blockquote>I will definitely get Better one code, one repo at a time</blockquote>
